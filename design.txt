PROBLEM STATEMENT:
What is the cost of your desired home? We want to give the user estimate of the house cost. First start with asking how many homes they want to build with a loop.
We will get this estimate by calculating the cost from the prompting the user to enter their desired square feet, 
number of rooms, number of bathrooms, number of windows, if they want a garage, if yes the square foot of the garage and if they want a basement.
You should display the output of all variables and the total cost of the home based on those factors.

Nouns: 
loop, 
user input such as:
number of houses
square footage
number of bedrooms
number of bathrooms
number of windows
garage
basement

Verbs:
prompt
calculate
output

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS: ' 
number of houses desired to build
square feet of house
number of bedrooms
number of bathrooms
number of windows
if they want a garage
garage square footage
if they want a basement

PROCESSING:
prompt for the input
calculate cost of the home
display the output

OUTPUTS:
house number
house square footage
number of bedrooms
number of bathrooms
number of windows
include garage and garage square footage if they want one
include basement if they want it 


</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>


<pre class="pseudocode">SOLUTION ALGORITHM GOES HERE:
EstimatingCostofHouseBuild
  prompt for user to enter number of houses they want to build, desired square footage, 
  number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and windows the house should have. 
  If they want a garage or not. If yes include garage and square footage of garage.
  If they want a basement include the basement.
  convert inputs to numbers
  calculate cost of the home or homes
  output the number of the home, all inputs and cost to build the home.

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: number of homes, square footage of home, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of windows, if they want a basement: Y or N, if they want a garage: Y or N, the garage square footage
